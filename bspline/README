@section documentation Documentation

For an overview of the library and its usage, see the documentation for the
BSplineBase class.

There is no documentation (as yet) on any of the mathematical details of
the implementation.  Refer to the Ooyama article, and there may be some
notes in the source.

The HTML documentation is generated from the source files by Doxygen
(http://www.doxygen.org).  Thanks to Dimitri for a great tool.

@section releasenotes Release Notes

<h2>Release 1_3</h2>

This release builds against GCC 4.0.  Names in the BSplineBase template
base class needed to be declared in the BSpline subclass scope, now that
GCC enforces the standard rule about non-template-type-dependent names
being resolved when templates are declared.

The driver program now takes an optional third command-line argument for
setting the boundary condition type.

There is an R script for generating plots of several combinations of the
cutoff and boundary condition options to the driver program.  See @ref 
samples for details.

<h2>Release 1_2</h2>

This release updates the code to compile with GCC 3.2, which enforces more
standards compliance like the use of 'typename'.  Also the GNU libstdc++ no
longer uses pointers as vector iterators, so occurences of
vector<>::begin() have been replaced with &(vector[0])

Lastly, in this release the C++ filename extension has been changed from
cxx to cpp.

@section samples Samples

The top source directory contains several sample data files for the driver
program.  The sample.txt file contains an example of dropsonde data.  From
that file, three fields have been extracted into separate files:

- sample.wdir	Wind direction
- sample.wspd Wind speed
- sample.temps Temperature

Each file is a simple text format with two columns.  The first column is
time, the second is the field measurement.  This is the format which the
example driver program expects.  Any text file with alternating X and Y
values will work in the driver program.

To run the driver program, pipe the data into the standard input, and pass
the @p step, @p cutoff, and @p boundary-condition options on the command
line.

@code
BSpline interface version: $Id$
BSpline implementation version: $Id$
Usage: ./driver <step> <cutoff> [<bc>]
  <step> is the number of points to skip in the input.
  <cutoff> is the cutoff wavelength.
  <bc> is the boundary condition--0, 1, or 2--meaning zero
       the 0th, 1st, or 2nd derivative at the end points.
@endcode

For example:

@code
./driver 1 5 2 < sample.temps
@endcode

The driver produces two output files:

- spline.out:	The computed spline function evaluated at 2000 evenly-spaced
		points along the X domain.  The first column is the X value,
		the second is the spline evaluation at that point, and the 
		third is the evaluation of the spline's first derivative.
- input.out:	This output contains the original input data in the first
		and second columns, and the third column holds the spline
		function evaluated on the original X values.

The R (http://www.r-project.org) script runs the driver program on the
sample temperatures over a range of boundary conditions and cutoff
frequencies.  The results are plotted in 6 PNG images.

<table border='2'>
<tr><th>Cutoff</th><th>BC 0</th><th>BC 1</th><th>BC 2</th></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td><a href='plot-1.png'>plot-1.png</a></td>
              <td><a href='plot-2.png'>plot-2.png</a></td>
              <td><a href='plot-3.png'>plot-3.png</a></td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td><a href='plot-4.png'>plot-4.png</a></td>
              <td><a href='plot-5.png'>plot-5.png</a></td>
              <td><a href='plot-6.png'>plot-6.png</a></td></tr>
</table>

Note that for boundary condition 0, the endpoints are not at zero as might
be expected.  The spline algorithm first removes the mean from the input
data to improve the matrix calculations, and the mean is added back in when
evaluating the spline at any point.  Thus the endpoints for boundary
condition 0 will actually be the mean value of the input range.  If you
need to force the endpoints to be zero, remove the mean from the data
before computing the spline, or else change the source code for computing
the spline.

@section background Background

This is a C++ implementation of a cubic b-spline least squares and
derivative constraint algorithm.  See the documentation for the BSplineBase
class (in BSpline/BSpline.h) for details.

This work was done for meteorological research at the University
Corporation for Atmospheric Research (http://www.ucar.edu/).  There is no
warranty of any kind.  Please see the COPYRIGHT file.

@section installation Installation

As the implementation itself is mostly template code, it is not necessary
to build the library separately.  The template implementation can be
included directly.  The templates can also be compiled for the usual float
and double types into their own object modules and library (DLL on Win32).
See the documentation for details.  The code is known to compile under the
GNU g++ compiler 3.2 (http://gcc.gnu.org/) and Microsft Developer Studio
Visual C++ version 6.0.

The distribution contains two parts.  The b-spline code itself is
contained in the lib/ directory, while the top directory only contains a
test driver program.  There are MS VC++ projects and/or workspaces for
both, but they may not be current.  On UNIX, running make in the top
directory builds only the driver program by including the template
implementation directly.  Run make in the lib directory to build a library
with float and double instantiations of the BSpline templates.

To install the code into an include directory, all of the *.cxx and *.h
files in lib/ must be copied into the include directory.

@section questions Questions

I'd be happy to try to answer any questions, and certainly happy to hear
about any bugs or improvements.
